200 words is only 3–4 paragraphs. Sometimes less. As for proportion of the page, it depends on whether it’s single- or double-spaced. Double-spaced, it would take up maybe 2/3 of the page. Single-space—less than half. And you have to be clearer on “standard report style.” There are quite a few.

Here’s a draft of a magazine article. I’ve marked the approximate areas for 200, 400, 600, and 800 words.

If you’re using Word (or any other word processor), there will be a “word count” function. It’ll count the entire essay. If you want to determine the word count for only a portion, highlight that portion and then select “word count.”
